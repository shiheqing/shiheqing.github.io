- **<u>Model-Free Risk-Neutral Density with Constrained Gaussian Process:</u>** <br><br>
I'm currently working on the estimation of predictive information for stocks from their options, together with my supervisors. We start from the *Breeden and Litzenberger (1978)* theorem and enhence the recovery of risk-neutral density (RND) by using a Gaussian process with constraints. The proposed constrained-GP RND-recovery method generates improved tail risk and moment estimations.

- **<u>Finance-informed Neural Networks for Option Pricing:</u>** <br><br>
We propose a Finance-informed Neural Network (FINN) framework for option pricing which encodes the domain knowledge given by the functional of an option pricing model who admits a (semi) closed-form solution into a data-driven neural network. Our FINN framwork allows a battery of option pricing functionals, and outperforms both the plain data-driven neural network, and the structural models, for the task of pricing and hedging.
