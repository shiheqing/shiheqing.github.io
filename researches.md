I'm currently working on the estimation of predictive information for stocks from their options, together with my supervisors. We start from the *Breeden and Litzenberger (1978)* theorem and enhence the recovery of risk-neutral density (RND) by using machine learning with constraints. The proposed constrained-machine-learning-empowered RND-recovery method generates improved tail risk and moment estimations.
